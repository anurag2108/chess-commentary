# Custom Chess Platform with Stockfish Evaluation & Deepseek Commentary

This project is a custom-built chess platform developed entirely in Python. It integrates a custom chess engine for managing game state and move validation, Stockfish for move analysis and evaluation, and a Deepseek large language model (accessed via Ollama) to generate exciting, tension-filled chess commentary. The commentary is then vocalized using a text-to-speech (TTS) engine.

## Features

- **Custom Chess Engine:**  
  - Handles move generation, validation, and game state management (see `chess_engine.py`).
  - Supports special moves such as castling and undo functionality.

- **User Interface:**  
  - Built with Pygame to render a chessboard and pieces.
  - Users interact via mouse clicks to make moves on the board (see `chess_main.py`).

- **Stockfish Integration:**  
  - After each move, Stockfish is used to analyze the board.
  - Generates three best move sequences (each sequence consists of 5 moves) along with a board evaluation.

- **Deepseek Commentary via Ollama:**  
  - Constructs a rich prompt that includes the entire move history, the latest move, and Stockfishâ€™s suggestions.
  - Passes the prompt to the Deepseek model to generate compelling, suspenseful commentary.
  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**  
  - Commentary generated by the LLM is vocalized using `pyttsx3`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Stockfish:** Download from [stockfishchess.org](https://stockfishchess.org/download/).  
- **Ollama:** Set up and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) with the Deepseek model (e.g., `deepseek-r1`).

### Setup Steps

1. Make sure to download the relevant stockfish binary and setup ollama to access deepseek model. The current model I use is - deepseek-r1:1.5b.
